# OpnEco: The FOSS companion of content writers.

## What is OpnEco?

"Ah, if only I could get someone to read this for feedback."
\
"Only if I could know which keywords to target..."
  
We all have been there, haven't we?

OpnEco is a Python3 project developed just for that. To be a constant companion throughout your content writing process. By content writers, for content writers.

## Salient features:

1. Hassle-free installation
2. Can work without Internet (some modules need them though.)

## Installation and usage:

OpnEco doesn't require any time-consuming installation. You can simply download, resolve its dependencies, and use it. Just ensure that during installation, you have a proper Internet connection and Python installed and properly configured. Windows users may need to check if Python is added to the ```PATH``` environment variable in their systems.

### Steps:

0. Download this project code and open the top-level directory.
1. Install the Python dependencies using ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` (or ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` if you have two versions of Python installed.)
2. Run init.py using ```python init.py``` (or ```python3 init.py``` if you have two versions of Python installed.)
3. Run manage.py using ```python manage.py runserver``` (or ```python3 manage.py runserver``` if you have two versions of Python installed.)
